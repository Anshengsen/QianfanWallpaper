EN：Academic still life composition, chiascuro lighting, mysterious and profound aura. The main subject is a bouquet of pure white roses, their petals elegantly arranged, with clear veins. Most of the flowers are immersed in deep shadowed areas, with only a few petals illuminated by a concentrated yet soft beam of light, forming a visual focal point, emphasizing the flower's form and delicacy. The light appears to emerge slowly from endless darkness, making the flowers seem both delicate and vibrant. The background is an boundless pure black, excluding all extra elements, further highlighting the flower's central position in the frame. The overall layout is simple and elegant, with light and shadow usage pushed to its extreme, creating an artistic and narrative-rich atmosphere. Ultra high resolution, extreme detail, professional grade, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
