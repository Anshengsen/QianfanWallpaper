EN：Classic still life close-up, dramatic lighting, profound atmosphere. The main subject is a blooming white rose, its petals layered and unfurling, with intricate details. Most of the flower is immersed in deep shadows, with only a few petals gently caressed by a soft beam of light, forming a sharp light-shadow contrast, highlighting the flower's spatial depth and delicate texture. The light seems to emerge from nothingness, bestowing upon the flower a fragile yet vibrant vitality. The background is a pure, abyssal darkness, devoid of any distracting elements, making the flower's presence even more striking. The overall composition is concise, with extreme use of light, creating an artistic and philosophical mood. Ultra high resolution, macro photography, top quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
