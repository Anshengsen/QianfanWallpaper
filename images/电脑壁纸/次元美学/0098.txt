CN：二维动画风格，破败艺术，扭曲笑颜。画面中央是一位黑发及腰的少女，她身穿简洁白衬衫和深色马甲，系着亮橙色领花。她唇角微挑，露出利齿，脸上带有旧伤，左眼下有几道缝合痕迹和血痕，鼻梁处贴着绷带，眼神中带着一丝癫狂。眼睛是灼目的琥珀色，与周遭阴郁的色彩形成鲜明反差。光线从右方照射，照亮人物脸部和衣衫局部，留下修长阴影。背景是废弃的白色砖墙，遍布红色喷漆与污迹，呈现一派萧条景象。整体画面黑暗沉重，洋溢着一种危险而偏执的美感。超高清，电影镜头感，卓越品质，8K。
EN：2D animation style, decay art, twisted grin. At the center of the image is a waist-length black-haired girl, wearing a simple white shirt and dark waistcoat, adorned with a bright orange neck bow. Her lips curve slightly, revealing sharp teeth, old scars on her face, with several suture marks and blood traces beneath her left eye, and a bandage on the bridge of her nose. Her gaze holds a hint of madness. Her eyes are blazing amber, forming a stark contrast with the surrounding gloomy colors. Light shines from the right, illuminating parts of her face and attire, casting long shadows. The background is a dilapidated white brick wall, covered in red spray paint and stains, presenting a desolate scene. The overall image is dark and heavy, exuding a dangerous and obsessive beauty. Ultra high definition, cinematic feel, excellent quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
