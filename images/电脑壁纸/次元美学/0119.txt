CN：二次元动漫风格，噬魂者的童话，影之瞳。画面主体是一位身形纤细的少年，黑色短发凌乱地覆盖着额头，几绺发丝被暗紫色的能量光芒缠绕。他的右眼紧闭，左眼是深邃的琥珀色，里面没有光，只有一片冰冷的虚无，眼周浮现有不规则的咒文。少年身穿破旧的黑色斗篷，上面沾染着未知的斑驳痕迹。光线从上方以一道极其锐利的光束穿透，只照亮了少年侧脸的一部分，使得另一半完全隐没在深不见底的阴影中。背景是扭曲的、被遗忘的古代魔法阵，散发着微弱的血红色幽光。整体画面压抑而充满禁忌感，诡异且引人深思。高分辨率，电影质感，高质量，8K。
EN：Two-dimensional anime style, soul eater's fairy tale, shadow eye. The main subject is a slender young boy with messy black hair covering his forehead, a few strands entwined with dark purple energy glows. His right eye is tightly closed, while his left eye is a profound amber, devoid of light, only cold emptiness within, with irregular runes floating around it. The boy wears a tattered black cloak stained with unknown mottled marks. Light pierces down from above in an extremely sharp beam, illuminating only a part of the boy's side face, leaving the other half completely immersed in bottomless shadow. The background is a distorted, forgotten ancient magic circle, emitting a faint blood-red spectral glow. The overall image is oppressive and filled with a sense of taboo, eerie and thought-provoking. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
