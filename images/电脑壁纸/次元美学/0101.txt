EN：Japanese manga style, whisperer of the deceased, ghost train arriving. The main subject is a female character wearing a worn-out kimono, her long hair blowing in the wind, revealing a pale neck with a slender black curse mark. Her eyes are hollow, as if seeing through life and death. Semi-transparent, floating specters, outlined by lines, vague and monstrous in form, surround the woman. The background features a ghost train, glowing with eerie green light, slowly emerging from the shadows, with faint silhouettes of tormented faces visible through its windows. Withered spider lilies are scattered on the ground, their petal edges highlighted with a faint purple-black luminescence. The overall image captures the atmosphere of Japanese urban legends and folk horror, with strong contrast in light and shadow, prominent line work, and specific color accents to create a mysterious, terrifying, and captivating visual. High resolution, manga panel, high quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
