EN：Japanese manga style, secretive allure, gothic fashion. At the center of the image is a female character with cascading black hair, bright blue-green highlights interwoven through the strands, and a few locks tied into bows with delicate ribbons. Her gaze is penetrating, pupils gleaming aqua-green with bright highlights, and a drop of black watery tear-mark beneath her eye, emphasizing her mystery. Her lips are painted with dark lilac lipstick, revealing a hint of an evil smile. Her left hand is slightly raised, fingertips slender. She wears three-dimensional floral earrings. Abstract skull elements are scattered throughout the scene, complementing the overall gothic atmosphere. The background is a deep pure purple, making the character image more prominent. The overall light and shadow effect is dramatic, and colors are rich, conveying a dark, supernatural, and powerful artistic sensation. Extreme clarity, cinematic aesthetic, professional standard, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
