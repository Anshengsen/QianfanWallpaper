EN：Japanese anime style, ruinous aesthetics, sinister smile. The main subject is a young female character, with waist-length dark hair, wearing a clean white shirt and a dark vest, tied with an orange necktie. Her lips curl upwards, revealing sharp teeth, scars visible on her face, with sutures and traces of blood beneath her left eye, and medical tape on the bridge of her nose. Her expression is slightly frenzied and uncanny. Her eyes glow with a bright orange-yellow, contrasting sharply with the overall dim color palette. Light casts from the right side of the frame, illuminating part of her face and clothing, casting long shadows. The background is a mottled white tiled wall, covered with ochre graffiti and stains, indicating decay and abandonment. The overall style is somber and oppressive, imbued with dangerous and morbid beauty. High resolution, cinematic texture, top quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
