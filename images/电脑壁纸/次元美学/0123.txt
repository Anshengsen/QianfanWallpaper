CN：二次元动漫风格，扭曲的低语，血腥的幻像。画面主体是一位年轻女性，她的长发如火焰般扭曲向上，部分发丝呈鲜亮的猩红色。她的面部被诡异的裂纹覆盖，尤其是右眼，仿佛被某种力量撕裂，露出深不见底的黑色空洞，其中闪烁着微弱的幽绿色光点。她身穿不规则剪裁的黑色连衣裙，边缘如同被撕扯般破损。她的双手交叉在胸前，指尖长出锋利的骨刺。背景是扭曲的、带有血迹的墙壁，墙上潦草地写满了无法辨认的符文和符号，远处有模糊的、低声耳语的幻影。整体氛围令人不安，视觉冲击力强，充满崩坏和异变的美感。高分辨率，电影质感，高质量，8K。
EN：Two-dimensional anime style, twisted whispers, sanguinary visions. The main subject is a young woman, her long hair twisting upwards like flames, some strands a vivid crimson. Her face is covered with eerie cracks, especially her right eye, which appears torn open by some force, revealing a bottomless black void twinkling with faint spectral green lights. She wears an irregularly cut black dress, its edges appearing ripped. Her hands are crossed over her chest, with sharp bone protrusions growing from her fingertips. The background is a warped, blood-stained wall, scribbled indistinctly with runes and symbols, with blurred, whispering phantoms in the distance. The overall atmosphere is unsettling, visually impactful, full of beauty in decay and mutation. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
