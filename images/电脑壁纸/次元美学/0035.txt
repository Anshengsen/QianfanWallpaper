EN：Japanese manga style, forgotten library, curse of knowledge. The main subject is a female character surrounded by books, sitting atop a precarious pile of ancient tomes, her long black hair cascading like ink. Her eyes are covered by a large, bandaged blindfold, with tears seeping from the bandage edge, leaving two dark streaks on her cheek. The girl wears a loose scholar's robe adorned with various line-drawn mysterious symbols, indicating strong line work. Several opened ancient scrolls float beside her, displaying blurred texts and patterns, their edges emitting a faint spectral blue glow. The background is an endless array of bookshelves, books piled high, their tops shrouded in heavy shadows, their bottoms covered with screentone textures. Light penetrates from the depths of the frame as a faint halo, emphasizing the scene's profoundness and tranquility. The overall image is imbued with a sense of weighty knowledge and forbidden secrets, featuring delicate character design, and using light and shadow with screentones to create a gloomy academic style unique to Japanese manga. High resolution, manga panel, high quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
