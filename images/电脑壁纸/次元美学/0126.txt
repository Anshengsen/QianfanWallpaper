EN：Two-dimensional anime cel-shaded style, dark silent inquisitor. The main subject is a slender female inquisitor, dressed entirely in black, featuring characteristic bold black outlines. Her long black hair is rendered with block-like shadows, occasionally glinting with hard-edged highlights. She wears a uniform composed of pure black and minimal dark gray color blocks, outlined with thick, bright white lines on the edges, and adorned with a purely flat, silver emblem. Her facial expression is calm and solemn, her eyes filled with flat, deep red blocks, punctuated by tiny, square white highlight dots in the pupils. Large, blocky shadows are cast around the character, as if she is enveloped by an unseen force. The background is pure deep black, devoid of any detail, with only a single straight, sharp white light beam emanating from behind the inquisitor, emphasizing her presence and solitude. The overall image features distinct colors, harsh lines, and a strong sense of flatness characteristic of cel animation, imbued with anime power. High resolution, cel-shaded render, high quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
