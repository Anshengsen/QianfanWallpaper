CN：日式漫画风格，被遗弃的绘影师，墨与血的交织。画面主体是坐在破旧画架前的瘦削少年，黑色长发遮住半边脸，仅露出一只黯淡无光的金色瞳孔。他的手指修长，紧握着一支滴着浓稠黑墨的画笔，笔尖触及的画布上，绘制着半幅扭曲而血腥的怪物肖像。少年身着沾满墨点和不明血迹的宽松白衬衫，线条勾勒出其疲惫的身形。光线从上方以破碎的条状打下，将画架和少年部分身体映照得明暗分明，其余则沉浸在由网点纸效果堆叠的厚重阴影中。背景是废弃的艺术工作室，窗外是漆黑的夜空和隐约的城市剪影。整体充满哥特式的阴郁和病态美感，线条细腻而富有张力，通过黑白与少量血红墨迹，营造出沉重而深远的日漫叙事氛围。高分辨率，漫画插画，高质量，8K。
EN：Japanese manga style, abandoned illustrator, intertwining ink and blood. The main subject is a lean boy sitting before a dilapidated easel, his long black hair obscuring half his face, revealing only a dull golden iris. His thin fingers tightly grip a paintbrush dripping with thick black ink, its tip touching a canvas where half a twisted and bloody monster portrait is being drawn. The boy wears a loose white shirt stained with ink blots and unknown bloodstains, lines delineating his weary figure. Light falls from above in broken streaks, illuminating the easel and parts of the boy's body with sharp contrasts, while the rest is plunged into heavy shadows composed of screentone patterns. The background is a derelict art studio, with a pitch-black night sky and faint city silhouettes visible outside the window. The overall image is filled with gothic gloom and morbid beauty, lines are delicate yet tense, creating a heavy and profound Japanese manga narrative atmosphere through black, white, and sparse blood-red ink stains. High resolution, manga illustration, high quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
