CN：动漫艺术渲染，磨损风格，畸形微笑。画面主体描绘一位年轻女性，垂腰黑发，着白衬衣配暗色无袖上衣，系火焰橙色细领带。她嘴角咧开，展示尖锐齿科，面部可见疤痕，左眼下方有不规则缝线与干涸血迹，鼻部有创口贴，表情略显失控。眼眸泛着炽热的橘光，与整体素暗的色调构成对比。光线从画面右侧打入，照亮了面部和衣物边缘，投下浓重阴影。背景是破损的白色瓷墙，饰有红色涂鸦和污渍，暗示着破坏后的残景。整体画面压抑而充满紧张感，展现出颓废而另类的美学。高分辨率，电影级画面，高质量，8K。
EN：Anime art rendering, worn aesthetic, deformed smile. The main subject depicts a young woman, with waist-length black hair, wearing a white shirt paired with a dark sleeveless top, tied with a flame-orange slender tie. Her lips are pulled back, revealing sharp dentition, scars visible on her face, with irregular sutures and dried blood beneath her left eye, and a bandage on her nose. Her expression is slightly uncontrolled. Her eyes glow with a fervent orange light, contrasting with the overall muted, dark tones. Light enters from the right side of the frame, illuminating her face and the edges of her clothing, casting deep shadows. The background is a damaged white tiled wall, adorned with red graffiti and stains, hinting at a scene of post-destruction ruins. The overall image is oppressive and tense, exuding a decadent and unconventional aesthetic. High resolution, cinematic imagery, high quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
