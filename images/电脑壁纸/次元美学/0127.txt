EN：Anime cel-shaded style, wasteland cyborg girl, glitching signal. The main subject is a girl with mechanical prosthetics, her body and outfit rendered with distinct, thick black cel-shaded outlines. Her short hair is composed of several sharp gray color blocks, with flat, orange-yellow highlights on top. The girl's mechanical arm is depicted with hard-edged, blocky metallic textures, with prominent red square accents at the joints. Her facial features are simple, her eyes large, pure blue circular color blocks, without pupils, but with two black "tear" outlines extending downwards from the corners. The background is a wasteland city constructed from fractured rectangular and triangular color blocks, with flat, smoking factory silhouettes in the distance. The sky is a high-contrast blend of deep gray and bright orange-yellow blocks. The image channels a glitch art aesthetic, with high color saturation presented as distinct blocks and bold lines, emphasizing the visual impact of cel-shaded style. High resolution, cel-shaded render, high quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
