EN：Cartoon animation style, achromatic dominant, complemented by vibrant cobalt blue, elegant and mysterious. The main subject is a female character looking into the distance in side profile, possessing healthy darker skin, her face veiled in shadow, with only sharp eyes and partial lines emerging from the darkness. Her hairstyle is shimmering light gray long hair, either braided or freely flowing. Around her neck, she wears a lustrous pearl necklace, and from her ears hang a pair of gem pendants sparkling with azure light; the blue light of the pendants is the only vivid color in the scene, exceptionally striking. Light shines from diagonally above or the side, outlining the edges of her hair, the curve of her neck, and part of her shoulders. The background is minimalist pure black, highlighting the character's aloofness and depth. The composition is precise, with interplaying light and shadow, full of contemplation. Ultra clear details, cinematic atmosphere, perfect quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
