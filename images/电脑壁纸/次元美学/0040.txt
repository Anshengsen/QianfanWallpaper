CN：日式漫画风格，终焉旅者的残影，寂灭的彼岸。画面中心是一位身披残破斗篷的男性角色，他的身形因风雨侵蚀显得摇摇欲坠，斗篷边缘以粗犷的线条勾勒，呈现出被撕裂的飞扬感。他的面部被帽兜的阴影完全笼罩，没有五官，只剩下一个深不见底的黑洞，但头部上方却漂浮着几道若隐若现的、象征性的蓝色火焰，如同破碎的灵魂之光。他拄着一根扭曲的、嵌有黑色晶体的长杖，杖头延展出缠绕的黑色线条。背景是无尽的黄泉路，以密集的黑白线条交织成扭曲的幻象，远处有几扇以网点纸填充的、通往异界的鬼门剪影。整体画面充满线条的力量，强调旅程的绝望与虚无，通过黑白对比和幽蓝色点缀，营造出强烈压抑且极具哲学意味的日漫式悲剧氛围。高分辨率，漫画插画，高质量，8K。
EN：Japanese manga style, afterimage of the final traveler, the desolate other side. The main subject is a male character cloaked in a tattered robe, his figure appearing precarious from wind and erosion, the robe's edges outlined with bold lines, depicting a torn, fluttering movement. His face is completely shrouded by the hood's shadow, devoid of features, leaving only a bottomless black void, yet above his head float faint, symbolic blue flames, like fragments of soul light. He leans on a twisted, black crystal-embedded staff, from whose head extend intricate black lines. The background is an endless river Styx, a twisted illusion formed by densely interwoven black and white lines, with a few gate-like silhouettes, filled with screentone patterns, leading to another world in the distance. The overall image is powerfully linear, emphasizing the journey's despair and nihilism, creating a strongly oppressive and philosophically rich Japanese manga tragic atmosphere through black and white contrast and spectral blue accents. High resolution, manga illustration, high quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
