二次元动漫风格，战损美学，诡异笑容。画面主体是一位年轻的女性角色，黑发及腰，身穿白色衬衫与深色背心，系着橘红色领结。她嘴角上扬，露出尖锐的牙齿，面部有伤痕，左眼下方有缝合线和血迹，鼻梁处贴有创口贴，表情略显疯狂和诡异。眼睛是明亮的橘黄色，与整体暗沉的色调形成对比。光线从右侧打来，照亮了面部和衣物的一部分，留下长长的阴影。背景是破旧的白色瓷砖墙壁，上面有红色涂鸦和污渍，显示出被破坏和废弃的场景。整体风格黑暗而压抑，充满了危险和病态的美感。高分辨率，电影质感，高质量，8K。
Two-dimensional anime style, war-damaged aesthetics, weird smile. The main subject of the picture is a young female character with black hair down to her waist, wearing a white shirt, dark vest, and an orange bow tie. The corners of her mouth are raised, revealing sharp teeth, her face is scarred, there are sutures and blood under her left eye, a band-aid is on the bridge of her nose, and her expression is slightly crazy and weird. The eyes are bright orange, contrasting with the overall dark tone. The light comes from the right, illuminating part of the face and clothing, leaving long shadows. The background is a shabby white tile wall with red graffiti and stains on it, showing a destroyed and abandoned scene. The overall style is dark and depressing, full of danger and morbid beauty. High resolution, movie texture, high quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
