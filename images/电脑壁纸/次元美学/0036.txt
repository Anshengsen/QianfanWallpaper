CN：日式漫画风格，失落神祇的残响，彼岸花的彼方。画面中心是一位身形单薄的少年，黑色的齐肩发随风微动，脸上没有任何表情，唯有那双巨大的、无光的琥珀色眼睛深邃得如同漩涡，眼中隐约浮现出残破的、如同雕塑般的破碎神像剪影。少年身着旧式校服，衣物边缘有细密的线条勾勒出的破损痕迹。他的手腕处延伸出数条细如发丝的黑色线条，连接着虚空中漂浮的、以网点纸填充的半透明彼岸花，花瓣边缘散发着微弱的幽蓝色余光。背景是纯粹的黑白色渲染，仿佛是由无数细密线条构成的扭曲空间，远处偶尔有几笔粗犷的墨迹暗示着未知深渊。整体画面静谧而压抑，充满宿命感和日式怪谈特有的氛围，光影以线条清晰分割，强调绝望中的一丝虚幻美感。高分辨率，漫画插画，高质量，8K。
EN：Japanese manga style, remnants of lost deities, beyond the spider lilies. At the center of the image is a slender boy with shoulder-length black hair gently swaying in the breeze, his face devoid of expression, only his large, lightless amber eyes are as deep as vortices, faintly reflecting the silhouette of broken, sculpted divine statues. The boy wears an old-style school uniform, its edges detailed with fine lines indicating wear and tear. Several hair-thin black lines extend from his wrist, connecting to translucent spider lilies filled with screentone patterns, floating in the void, their petal edges emitting a faint spectral blue afterglow. The background is rendered in pure black and white, appearing as a distorted space composed of countless fine lines, with occasional bold ink strokes in the distance hinting at an unknown abyss. The overall image is quiet and oppressive, imbued with a sense of fate and the unique atmosphere of Japanese urban legends, light and shadow clearly divided by lines, emphasizing a illusory beauty amidst despair.
