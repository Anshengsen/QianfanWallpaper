CN：日式漫画风格，被侵蚀的记忆，倒影中的幻像。画面主体是一位女性角色，她沉静地坐在湖边，湖面平静如镜，但湖水中却倒映出一个扭曲的、由线条勾勒的怪物剪影，怪物头部生有数只不规则的眼睛，背景是破碎的城市废墟。女性的长发以流畅的线条描绘，发丝间偶尔有几片腐烂的枯叶。她的连衣裙干净、笔直，但裙摆下方却延伸出数条如同触手般蔓延的黑色线条，深入湖中。光线以强烈的边缘光形式勾勒出女性的轮廓，其余部分则被深邃的阴影笼罩，湖面有反射的微弱光点。画面通过镜像构图强调了现实与幻象的对比，线条细腻，情感复杂，营造出一种唯美而绝望的日漫悲剧氛围。高分辨率，漫画分镜，高质量，8K。
EN：Japanese manga style, corrupted memories, phantom in reflection. The main subject is a female character, sitting calmly by a lake, the water's surface as still as a mirror, yet in the reflection appears a distorted, line-drawn silhouette of a monster with several irregular eyes on its head, against a backdrop of shattered city ruins. The woman's long hair is depicted with fluid lines, with occasional decayed leaves intertwined in her strands. Her dress is clean and straight, but beneath the hem, several black lines, like spreading tentacles, extend into the lake. Light outlines the woman's figure with strong rim lighting, while the rest is enveloped in deep shadows, with faint points of light reflecting on the lake surface. The image emphasizes the contrast between reality and illusion through mirrored composition, with delicate lines and complex emotions, creating an aesthetic yet desperate Japanese manga tragedy. High resolution, manga panel, high quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
