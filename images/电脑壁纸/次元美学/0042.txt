EN：Japanese manga style, fringe dweller of the final city, whisper of the abandoned train. The main subject is a boy kneeling inside an abandoned train car, clutching his knees, his head buried deep, long hair disheveled on the train floor. The train car interior is dimly lit, with only a few blurry light beams penetrating through distant windows, faintly outlining the boy's slender figure. Around the boy lie several cracked, line-drawn dolls, one with a head tilted askew, revealing empty eyes. The train car walls are covered with graffiti and rusted patches rendered with screentone effects, and outside the window is an endless city silhouette shrouded in mist. The overall image is filled with a sense of oppression and solitude, strong in line work, creating extreme decay and despair through light and shadow, combining common Japanese manga post-apocalyptic themes with profound character introspection. High resolution, manga illustration, high quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
