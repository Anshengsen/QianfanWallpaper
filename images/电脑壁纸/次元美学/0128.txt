EN：Japanese manga style, abyss summoner, lonely boy. The main subject is a teenager with a delicate face and slightly disheveled black long hair, with a few strands falling over his clear blue pupils. His eyes are profound, gazing into the unknown distance beyond the frame, faint ominous rune-like glows subtly flickering within his pupils. The boy wears a black coat with intricate straps and metal buckles, lines delineating the garment's layers and worn appearance. On the right side of the frame, a mysterious creature with colossal, raven-feathered wings is largely shrouded in shadow, revealing only sharp claws and one or two feathers emitting a faint red light. The background is a vast void rendered with black inking and grayscale effects, with occasional powerful lines converging from the distance towards the boy, emphasizing the scene's tension. The overall image is rich in linear strength, with nuanced character expressions, muted colors accented by sparse monochromatic hints, creating a strong narrative sense and a mysterious, oppressive atmosphere. High resolution, manga panel, high quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
