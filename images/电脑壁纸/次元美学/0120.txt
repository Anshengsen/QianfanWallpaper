CN：动漫风格，寂灭回响，腐朽之歌。画面中央是一位被锁链束缚的女性，她双膝跪地，黑色的长发散落在她身旁破碎的锁链碎片之间。她的脸庞被痛苦扭曲，但瞳孔深处却燃烧着一丝不屈的苍白色火焰。她身着曾经华丽如今残破不堪的礼服，布料边缘破损，露出下方的暗色纹身。光线极其微弱，仅从上方洒落，勉强勾勒出她被束缚的身躯和冰冷的面部线条，周围是无尽的黑暗，远处似有若无的腐朽建筑剪影。整个画面充满绝望与反抗，哥特式美学与悲剧色彩融合。高分辨率，史诗感，高质量，8K。
EN：Anime style, echo of oblivion, song of decay. At the center of the image is a woman bound by chains, kneeling, her long black hair scattered among the fragments of shattered chains beside her. Her face is twisted in pain, yet in the depths of her pupils, a pale, unyielding flame burns. She wears what was once a magnificent gown, now tattered and broken, its edges frayed, revealing dark tattoos beneath. The light is extremely faint, just spilling from above, barely outlining her bound body and cold facial contours, surrounded by endless darkness, with faint silhouettes of decayed buildings in the distance. The entire image is filled with despair and defiance, blending gothic aesthetics with tragic undertones. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
