CN：日式漫画风格，血蔷薇的低语，被诅咒的新娘。画面主体是一位女性角色，她身着带有繁复花边和褶皱图案的哥特式长裙，全身线条感极强。她拥有长而卷曲的黑发，发丝间缠绕着几朵黑色枯萎的蔷薇，花瓣边缘有细微的红色血迹点缀。她的脸庞精致而苍白，眼神忧郁且透露着一丝疯狂，一滴黑色的泪水从眼角滑落。画面的光线处理如同漫画中常见的强对比，光源来自左侧，将人物一半面部照亮，另一半隐没在由网点纸效果填充的阴影中。背景是模糊但充满线条感的古老教堂窗户剪影，窗棂上攀爬着带刺的藤蔓。构图富有戏剧性，人物造型和表情细节丰富，色彩以黑、灰、红为主，充满悲剧美感和日漫独有的线条表现力。高分辨率，漫画插画，高质量，8K。
EN：Japanese manga style, whisper of blood roses, cursed bride. The main subject is a female character, adorned in a gothic long dress with intricate lace and ruffled patterns, her entire form defined by strong lines. She possesses long, curly black hair, intertwined with several withered black roses, their petal edges subtly accented with tiny red bloodstains. Her face is delicate and pale, her gaze melancholic and tinged with madness, a single black tear tracing a path from the corner of her eye. The lighting is treated with high contrast, typical of manga, with light originating from the left, illuminating half of her face while the other half is consumed by shadows filled with screentone patterns. The background is a blurred but highly linear silhouette of an ancient cathedral window, with thorny vines creeping along its frame. The composition is dramatic, rich in character design and expression details, with a color palette primarily black, grey, and red, imbued with tragic beauty and the unique linear expressiveness of Japanese manga. High resolution, manga illustration, high quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
