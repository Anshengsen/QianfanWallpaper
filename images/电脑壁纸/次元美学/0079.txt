EN：2D animation illustration, main tones black, white, and gray, complemented by scarlet and emerald colors, pervading a cool and detached atmosphere. The central figure is a short-haired young woman, slowly appearing from the right side of the composition, her body partially hidden in the dark backdrop, showing only her upper torso. She wears comfortable clothing, with light-colored sleeves adorned with dark trim. On her head, she wears bright red headphones, covering her ears, with the connecting cable naturally hanging down. Her right eye is emerald green, and her left eye is obscured by hair. A white decorative patch is on her face. The character's expression is tranquil, with a hint of sorrow. The background is a deep black, with almost no other visual elements, emphasizing the character's independence. The design layout is simple, with strong light and shadow contrast, making the character's silhouette prominent. High resolution, cinematic look, ultimate quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
