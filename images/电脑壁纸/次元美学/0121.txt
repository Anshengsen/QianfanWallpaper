EN：Japanese anime art, night wanderer, phantom traversing. The main subject is a male character, his black trench coat flapping violently with rapid movement, his silhouette appearing exceptionally sharp in the blurred night. His form is enveloped by thin purple lightning bolts, leaving fleeting afterimages behind him. His face is obscured by a hood and shadow, with only sharp crimson light emanating from his eye sockets, full of vigilance and lethal intent. The background is a heavily clouded city, with gothic spires faintly visible, and oppressive mist permeating the air. The overall light and shadow effect is strong, and the colors are cool, creating an atmosphere of speed, danger, and mystery. High resolution, motion capture, high quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
