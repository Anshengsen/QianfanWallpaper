EN：Japanese manga style, vendetta of the blood droplet, night hunter. The main subject is a male character leaping across city rooftops, his agile body full of linear power and speed. He wears tight black attire, a cape billowing behind him, its edges sharply defined by bold lines. His face is concealed by a mask, revealing only a pair of cold, red glowing eyes with elongated, beast-like pupils. His left hand grips a massive, blood-red scythe with jagged edges, and the blade features copious line-drawn blood splatter effects. The background is a predominantly black, white, and gray night city landscape, with towering buildings outlined by harsh lines, occasionally accented by blurred neon glows in the distance, and a gloomy, overcast sky rendered with a screentone-like texture. The overall composition is dynamic, with light and shadow emphasizing the character's shadowed nature, a perfect blend of violent aesthetics and Japanese manga's linear expressiveness. High resolution, manga illustration, high quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
