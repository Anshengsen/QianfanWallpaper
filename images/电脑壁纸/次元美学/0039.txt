CN：日式漫画风格，被遗忘的玩偶师，寂静的午夜仪式。画面主体是一位坐在破损木偶前的女性，她身形瘦弱，披散着一头线条感清晰的黑色长发，其中几缕如同丝线般缠绕在她的手指上。她的目光低垂，眼中没有光，只有一片深灰色的空洞，嘴角微微上扬，带着一丝诡异的疯狂。女性身穿带有繁复褶皱和线条感的黑白女仆装，臂弯里抱着一个只有一半脸是玩偶面具、一半是骷髅的面具玩偶。光线非常微弱，从画面左上角以斜向阴影打下，将大部分场景覆盖，只有人物的轮廓和玩偶面具被边缘光微弱照亮。背景是杂乱而充满线条感的废弃房间，家具破损，墙壁上布满了网点纸般的霉斑。整体画面充满日系哥特萝莉和超自然元素，线条勾勒出病态美感，通过强烈的明暗对比和静默的氛围，营造出令人不安的午夜童话感。高分辨率，漫画分镜，高质量，8K。
EN：Japanese manga style, forgotten puppeteer, silent midnight ritual. The main subject is a frail female figure sitting before a damaged wooden puppet, her long black hair rendered with clear lines, a few strands like threads wrapped around her fingers. Her gaze is cast downward, her eyes lightless, only deep gray voids, a subtle, eerie smile curving on her lips with a hint of madness. She wears a black and white maid outfit with intricate pleats and strong lines, holding a mask-puppet in the crook of her arm that is half-doll mask, half-skull. The light is very faint, casting diagonal shadows from the upper left, covering most of the scene, with only the character's outline and the puppet mask faintly illuminated by rim lighting. The background is a cluttered and highly linear abandoned room, with broken furniture and walls covered in screentone-like mold. The overall image is filled with Japanese gothic lolita and supernatural elements, lines delineating a morbid beauty, creating an unsettling midnight fairy tale atmosphere through strong chiaroscuro and a silent ambiance. High resolution, manga panel, high quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
