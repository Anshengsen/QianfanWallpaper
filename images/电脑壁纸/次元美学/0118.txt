EN：Japanese anime art, gothic combat, sword dancer in collapsing space. The image depicts a female swordswoman in tight black armor, with disheveled long hair. She leaps into the air, her katana leaving dark red afterimages as she strikes an unseen enemy. Where her sword slashes, pixelated cracks and purple-black energy overflow from the space. Her expression is stern and focused, with a hint of madness in her eyes. The background consists of shattered geometric forms and a floating, noisy, blood-red sky. The image conveys a strong sense of motion, with impactful light and shadow treatment, creating a visual effect where power and destruction coexist. High resolution, motion capture, high quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
