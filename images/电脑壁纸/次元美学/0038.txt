CN：日式漫画风格，被侵蚀的武士，恶灵缠身。画面中央是一位身着传统武士服的男性角色，他的头部低垂，全身被由细密线条构成的黑色“裂纹”覆盖，仿佛是被某种腐蚀力量侵蚀。他的武士刀虽然握在手中，但刀身也布满了类似的裂纹，刀刃处散发出不祥的幽绿色光晕。武士的周围萦绕着几团模糊的、扭曲的黑色烟雾，烟雾中隐约可见痛苦的面孔剪影。光线以强烈的逆光效果从武士身后打来，将他塑造成一个巨大的剪影，面部细节被掩盖，只剩下轮廓和那“裂纹”在黑暗中清晰分界。背景是荒凉的、线条感极强的废弃寺庙，枯萎的树木和破碎的石灯笼构成冷冽的框架。整体画面充满悲怆与宿命感，线条构成了大部分画面信息，通过黑白对比和少量色彩点缀，营造出深刻的日漫式悲剧美学。高分辨率，漫画插画，高质量，8K。
EN：Japanese manga style, corroded samurai, haunted by malevolent spirits. At the center of the image is a male character in traditional samurai attire, his head bowed, his body covered in black "cracks" made of fine lines, as if corroded by some force. His katana, though held in hand, is also riddled with similar cracks, its blade emitting an ominous spectral green glow. Several blurred, twisted black smoke wisps surround the samurai, faintly revealing silhouettes of tormented faces within. Light strikes from behind the samurai with a strong rim-lighting effect, casting him into a large silhouette, facial details obscured, leaving only his outline and the "cracks" distinctly divided in the darkness. The background is a desolate, highly linear abandoned temple, with withered trees and broken stone lanterns forming a stark frame. The overall image is filled with pathos and a sense of fate, lines compose most of the visual information, creating a profound Japanese manga-style tragic aesthetic through black and white contrast and subtle color accents. High resolution, manga illustration, high quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
