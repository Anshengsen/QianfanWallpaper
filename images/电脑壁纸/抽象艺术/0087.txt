Abstract art, highly saturated colors, fluidity, and natural textures. The picture is presented from a bird's-eye view, and the overall color is colorful. Highly saturated blue, green, yellow, purple and other colors are intertwined to form a flowing visual effect. On the left side of the picture, clear light blue and light yellow sand with subtle ripples are intertwined, like the texture of fine sand after the waves fade. The right side is darker, transitioning from dark blue to purple-red with a glimmer, and there is a clear curve separating the two parts, as if it is a coastline or the boundary between different water currents. The light creates a subtle sense of layering and transparency in the picture, making the colors more vivid. The overall composition is full of fluidity and natural rhythm, like paint smudged in the water. High resolution, macro details, high quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
