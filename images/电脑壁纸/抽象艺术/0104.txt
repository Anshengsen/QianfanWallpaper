CN：抽象艺术，光之侵蚀，熵的律动。画面主体是纯黑背景中一个巨大的、不规则的灰色球体或核心，其表面被无数细小的、如同线虫般的白色光线不断侵蚀和穿透，光线在核心内部形成复杂的、类似神经元的网络。部分光线从球体中爆发出来，以不稳定的弧线向外蔓延，边缘带有微弱的红色辉光。核心周围的黑暗中，有零星的黑色漂浮粒子，增加了空间的深度。整体构图展现了无形的侵蚀和能量的耗散，光影动态而紧张，色彩以黑白灰为主，辅以少量红白微光，营造出一种生命逝去、混沌重生的压抑美感。高分辨率，概念，高质量，8K。
EN：Abstract art, light erosion, rhythm of entropy. The main subject is a massive, irregular gray sphere or core against a pure black background, its surface constantly eroded and pierced by countless tiny, worm-like white light beams. These lights form a complex, neuron-like network within the core. Some light erupts from the sphere, spreading outwards in unstable arcs with a faint red glow at their edges. In the darkness surrounding the core, sporadic black floating particles add depth to the space. The overall composition depicts invisible erosion and energy dissipation, with dynamic and tense light and shadow, colors primarily black, white, and gray, augmented by sparse red and white glimmers, creating an oppressive aesthetic of life's passing and chaotic rebirth. High resolution, concept, high quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
