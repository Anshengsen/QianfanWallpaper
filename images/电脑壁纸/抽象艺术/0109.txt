CN：抽象艺术，遗忘的矩阵，编码的哀嚎。画面展现一个由密集而冰冷的蓝紫色光栅线条构成的三维矩阵，它在纯黑背景中以不规则的节奏闪烁并微弱地变形。矩阵的某些交汇点，会短暂地迸发出如同数据错误般的红色像素点和破碎的绿色光束，这些故障迅速蔓延，但在即将扩散前又被无形的力量吸回，回归到冷硬的光栅中。整体构图充满科技感和故障艺术的美学，光线变化暗示着数字世界的崩坏与秩序的挣扎，带来一种冷峻而充满张力的视觉体验。高分辨率，未来主义，高质量，8K。
EN：Abstract art, forgotten matrix, coded wail. The picture shows a three-dimensional matrix composed of dense and cold blue-purple grating lines, which flickers and deforms slightly in an irregular rhythm against a pure black background. At certain intersections of the matrix, red pixels and broken green beams like data errors will briefly burst out. These faults spread rapidly, but before they spread, they are sucked back by invisible forces and return to the cold and hard grating. The overall composition is full of a sense of technology and the aesthetics of glitch art. The changes in light suggest the collapse of the digital world and the struggle between order, bringing a cold and tense visual experience. High resolution, futurism, high quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
