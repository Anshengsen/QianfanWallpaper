CN：抽象艺术，虚空之花，能量的凋零。画面中央是一个由透明的、脆弱的光线组成的抽象花朵，花瓣由极致纤细的银灰色线条勾勒，内部则填充着柔和而微弱的蓝色或紫色渐变光晕。花朵正在缓慢地凋零，一些花瓣的末端正在解体成无数细小的、闪烁的黑色尘埃，这些尘埃在纯黑背景中围绕花朵旋转，最终消散。光线赋予花朵一种脆弱而空灵的美感，同时黑色尘埃的流逝强调了能量的消散和终结。整体构图安静而充满诗意，光影细腻，营造出一种关于存在与消逝的哲学氛围。高分辨率，概念，高质量，8K。
EN：Abstract art, flowers of the void, the withering of energy. In the center of the picture is an abstract flower composed of transparent, fragile light, the petals are outlined by extremely thin silver-gray lines, and the interior is filled with soft and faint blue or purple gradient halos. The flower is slowly withering, and the ends of some petals are disintegrating into countless tiny, flickering black dust, which rotates around the flower against a pure black background and eventually dissipates. The light gives the flower a fragile and ethereal beauty, while the passing of black dust emphasizes the dissipation and end of energy. The overall composition is quiet and poetic, with delicate light and shadow, creating a philosophical atmosphere about existence and disappearance.
