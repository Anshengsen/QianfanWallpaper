EN：Pixel style artwork, cyberpunk aesthetic, data corruption art. At the core of the image is a program-error mood symbol composed of pure white squares and curves, exhibiting a distinct pixelated grain, accompanied by significant RGB color separation, with cyan and purple halos around, creating depth of field and visual distortion. The two white square eyes have blue and green glows, the mouth is a white crescent shape, with cyan and purple separation at its edges. Multiple colors layer, presenting a visual effect of signal interference or system crash. The background is a profound pure black, further strengthening the symbol's visual power. The overall image is condensed, imbued with a sense of technology and rich emotion. High resolution, computer graphics, excellent quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
