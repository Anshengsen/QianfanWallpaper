EN：Conceptual art, futuristic aesthetic, three-dimensional geometric floral. The core of the image is an abstract flower composed of layered multi-dimensional geometric units. The outer petals are a deep, enigmatic black, while the inner layers transition from pale violet to deep eggplant purple, with a soft halo emanating from the center, forming a unique visual focal point. Below the flower is a streamlined abstract wavy base, in a gray-purple hue, harmoniously unified with the main subject's colors. The overall form is simple yet deeply layered, with exquisite light and shadow details, emphasizing the petals' curvature and substantial feel. The background is a pure ink black, making the subject more prominent, imbued with a forward-looking and high-end texture. Ultra high resolution, digital sculpture feel, top quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
