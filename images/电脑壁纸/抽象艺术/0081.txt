CN：像素化图像，网络朋克氛围，故障艺术表现。画面中心是一个由粗糙白色方块和弧形线条构成的故障表情标志，带有强烈的像素化质感，并展现出明显的色彩通道分离，红色与蓝色光影交织，产生立体感和信号干扰。两个白色矩形眼部下方有蓝色与红色光泽，嘴巴是白色的弧形，边缘有绿色与蓝色分离。这些色彩交错叠加，形成了一种数字错误或传输故障的视觉。背景为全黑色，更加突出了表情标志的视觉冲击。整体构图简约而有力，充满未来科技感和情感张力。高精度，数字艺术，完美质量，8K。
EN：Pixelated image, cyber-punk atmosphere, glitch art expression. At the center of the image is a glitched emoticon constructed from rough white squares and curved lines, possessing a strong pixelated texture, and displaying obvious color channel separation, with red and blue light and shadow intertwined, producing a three-dimensional effect and signal interference. Below the two white rectangular eyes are blue and red glows, and the mouth is a white arc, with green and blue separation at its edge. These colors interlace and superimpose, forming a visual of digital error or transmission failure. The background is entirely black, further highlighting the emoticon's visual impact. The overall composition is simple yet powerful, full of futuristic technology and emotional intensity. High precision, digital art, perfect quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
