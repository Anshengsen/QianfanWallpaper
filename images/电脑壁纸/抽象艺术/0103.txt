CN：抽象艺术，深渊之门，维度裂缝。画面主体是纯黑背景中央一道巨大而深邃的裂缝，裂缝边缘由不规则的、锐利的几何线条构成，仿佛空间被某种巨大力量撕裂。裂缝内部深不见底，隐约有数道细微的、不稳定的蓝紫色冷光从中逸散而出，光线扭曲盘旋，像是在吸附周围的黑暗。裂缝的边缘镶嵌着模糊的、如同破碎的黑色晶体般的纹理。整体构图简约而强大，强调线条和光影的对比，营造出一种虚无、冰冷且探索未知的神秘氛围。高分辨率，数字艺术，高质量，8K。
EN：Abstract art, abyss gate, dimensional rift. The main subject is a massive and profound rift in the center of a pure black background, its edges formed by irregular, sharp geometric lines, as if space has been torn apart by some colossal force. The rift's interior is bottomless, with several faint, unstable blue-violet cold lights subtly emanating from it, twisting and swirling as if absorbing the surrounding darkness. The edges of the rift are adorned with blurred, fragmented black crystal-like textures. The overall composition is simple yet powerful, emphasizing the contrast of lines and light and shadow, creating a void, icy, and mysterious atmosphere of exploring the unknown. High resolution, digital art, high quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
