EN：Futuristic illustration, cybernetic sculpture aesthetic, structured crystal plant. The main subject is a conceptual floral constructed from precise polygons. Its outer elements are an ultimate ink black, while the inner structure displays a gradient spectrum from lavender to deep purple, with a subtle luminescence emanating from its core, creating a unique visual center. The base of the floral form is a flowing abstract curved platform, in a hazy gray-purple color, perfectly integrated with the flower's hues. The overall form is fluid and richly layered, with meticulous light and shadow rendering, highlighting the curved surfaces and thickness of its components. The background is an endless pure black, making the subject more impactful, imbued with a sci-fi and refined sensibility. High resolution, computer graphics art, excellent quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
