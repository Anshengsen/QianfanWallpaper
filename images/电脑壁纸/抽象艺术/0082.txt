Abstract art, flowing light and shadow, mysterious atmosphere. The main body of the picture is composed of blurred light spots and rays, which flow vertically in the dark space. The main colors are soft blue, warm orange and partial white halo, which interweave with each other to form a dreamy and unpredictable visual effect. The light has no clear entity, as if it is an abstract energy flow or a light spot under the lens's out-of-focus. The background is deep black, making the colors of light and shadow more vivid and prominent. The overall composition is simple, aiming to create an abstract, mysterious and cinematic atmosphere. High resolution, movie texture, high quality, 8K. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy
