EN：Night view of the Dutch canal, realistic style, warm sunset tones, soft lights, reflected on the calm canal water, creating a peaceful and tranquil atmosphere. The picture contains neatly arranged Dutch characteristic buildings, boats moored on both sides of the canal, bicycles parked on the shore, and strong tree branches. The composition is symmetrical, and the perspective is slightly upward, highlighting the color contrast between the building and the sky. Similar to the style of landscape photography or post-processing, it pays attention to details and light and shadow effects. The overall tone is warm, with a strong European small town style. High resolution, high quality. --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy --no ai-generated texture
